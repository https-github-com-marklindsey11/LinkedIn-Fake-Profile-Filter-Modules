The benefit of code that is standalone video mirroring is that it allows users to view the same video on multiple devices simultaneously. This is especially useful if users want to watch a video together but are in different locations. Additionally, standalone mirroring can be used to record videos in order to make copies or back up the original video.

import cv2

video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0) # 0 is the default webcam
 
while True:
    # Capture frame-by-frame
    ret, frame = video_capture.read()
 
    # Mirror the frame
    mirrored_frame = cv2.flip(frame, 1)
 
    # Display the resulting frame
    cv2.imshow('Mirrored Video', mirrored_frame)
 
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break
 
# When everything is done, release the capture
video_capture.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

This system is designed to automate the process of discovering covert and clandestine Russian networks that bypass sanction restrictions and facilitate money laundering and terrorism financing. It uses a combination of open-source tools including Shodan, DNSDumpster, Phish Tool, Posh, Teleport, Virus Tool, OpenCTI, Manuka, Fast Incident Response, YARA, and OpenCVE to identify potential vulnerabilities and exposed assets, map domains and subdomains, create phishing email templates, send phishing emails, access targets, scan for malware and suspicious files, gather intelligence of threat-actors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures, analyze the system and alert on any suspicious activity, and identify and detect known vulnerabilities in the target systems. The benefits of this system are that it automates the process of discovering covert and clandestine Russian networks, which would otherwise be a time-consuming and tedious task. This system can help organizations uncover any potential threats and vulnerabilities in their networks, and take the necessary steps to protect their systems from malicious actors.
